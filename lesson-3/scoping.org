* Variable Scoping

The last topic I want to touch on in this lesson is variable scoping.
When you create a variable at the "global level" it is accesible to
anything inside the script however when you create a variable inside a
code block it is only known inside that code block.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # This variable can be referenced anywhere
    globe_trotter = 5

    def anotherfunction():
	# this will cause the script to fail. y is not defined in this scope
	print(y)

    def afunction():
	print(globe_trotter)
	y = 10

    print(globe_trotter)
    afunction()
    anotherfunction()
#+END_SRC

This also means that anything you create inside a loop is not accessible
outside the loop. This includes the variables made in a for loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  some_names = ["mat", "joey", "scott"]

  for name in names:
     # This will work since it is inside the loop
     print(name)

  # This will fail because it is not inside the loop so name is undefined.
  print(name)
#+END_SRC

Additionally if we want to modify a global inside a function we have
to specify this using the global keyword.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  globe_trotter = 5

  def afunction():
      print(globe_trotter)
      y = 10


  def bfunction():
      global globe_trotter
      globe_trotter += 1

  afunction() # prints 5
  bfunction()
  afunction() # prints 6
#+END_SRC

global will either declare a new global or grab an existing global
variable and let you modify it.

This should be pretty simple but can lead to some gotcha moments.
