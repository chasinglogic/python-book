# Homework

1.  Write down or type out the definitions for the following terms:

2.  HashMap
3.  Iteration
4.  Array
5.  Multi dimensional array

6.  Write a script which prompts a user for a number and counts from 1 to
	the user inputted number the documentation for prompting for input in
	python can be found
	[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input)
	Use if statements to validate input, for example don't just crash if
	the user inputs `hello`, give them a useful error message. You can
	use either a while or a for loop for this.

7.  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for
	multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the
	multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of
	both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

For the first fifteen numbers the output will look like this:

	1
	2
	Fizz
	4
	Buzz
	Fizz
	7
	8
	9
	Buzz
	11
	Fizz
	13
	14
	FizzBuzz

1.  Create a dictionary representation for 5 dogs, put those dictionaries
	into an array. Iterate over that array printing each key and value
	for each dog with a blank new line between each dog. Your output
	should look something like this:

	name Tanker
	breed Boston Terrier

	name Chewbacca
	breed Rotweiler

	name Roscoe
	breed Pug

	name Einstein
	breed Chihuahua

	name Chuggers
	breed Puggle

Track a little more information than just name and breed.
