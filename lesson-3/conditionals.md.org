* Conditionals
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: conditionals
  :END:

Conditionals (sometimes referred to as Control Flow) are ways that we
can actually make our programs do some logic. The most basic is the if
statement and it's variants which look pretty much how you'd expect.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if True:
        print("True is true it turns out!")

    if False:
        print("Skip me because False is false!")
#+END_SRC

What do you think the output will be? Type it out then run this program.

Of course using constants isn't any better since we know that True is
true so in Python we have some comparison operators that way we can
determine if something is True or not when our program is running:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ==
#+END_EXAMPLE

This means "is equal to" so if you see 5 == 3 that is false but 5 == 5
is true. you can use variables here as well that way you may not know
the value ahead of time. Let's say you have a function

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def comparator(x, y):
        return x == y
#+END_SRC

And you call it with comparator(5, 3) it will return False.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > or <
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is exactly like you remember from middle school (see programming is
so easy you learned most of this when you were 12.) "greater than" or
"less than" is the easiest 5 < 5 is false but 3 < 5 is True.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <= or >=
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Less than or equal to" or "Greater than or equal to" these are the same
as above except they also check for == so 5 < 5 is False but 5 <= 5 is
True

With this in mind let's type a simple script.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    x = 5
    y = 10

    if x >= y:
        print("x is greater than or equal to y")

    if x < y:
        print("x is less than y")

    if x == y:
        print("x and y have the same value.")
#+END_SRC

Try to reason through this program before running it. Then I want you to
modify it so that all the conditionals evaluate to True (there are
multiple answers but don't just use True as a literal for all the if
statements.)

* A quick aside
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-quick-aside
  :END:

So when we did math operators in Lesson 1 I forgot about an operator
that really only comes into play when dealing with conditionals and that
is the modulo operator. (in python it's represented as %)

The Modulo operator does what every Elementary math student does, long
division with a Remainder. The modulo will return that remainder

So 5 % 3 will give you 2 since 3 only "goes into" 5 once and has 2 left
over.

I think putting an entire refresher on long division in here is
unnecessary and distracting so if you need one I recommend
[[https://www.mathsisfun.com/long_division2.html][this one]]

* Back to conditioning
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: back-to-conditioning
  :END:

Now if you want to chain conditions you can do as we did above however
if two of the conditions are true (such as if x = 5 and y = 5) you will
trigger two print statements

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if x >= y:
        print("x is greater than or equal to y")

    if x == y:
        print("x and y have the same value.")
#+END_SRC

Since 5 is greater than or equal to 5 and 5 is also equal to 5.

So what if you only want one print statement to fire? This is where you
need an else if statement.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if x < y:
        print("x is less than y")
    else:
        print("x is greater than y")
#+END_SRC

This will execute the first statement if the if is true otherwise it
will execute the else!

For example given that x = 3 and y = 5 you will only get one line of
output:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    x is less than y
#+END_EXAMPLE

And if x = 3 and y = 3 you will still only get one line of output:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    x is greater than y
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which isn't necessarily true but it does make the above if statement
evaluate to false since 3 is not less than 3

Expanding on this we can do an else if which allows us to chain our
conditions so we can catch this edge case.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if x < y:
        print("x is less than y")
    elif x == y:
        print("x is equal to y")
    else:
        print("x is greater than y")
#+END_SRC

Now when we run python will check each condition in order. Here is a
simple plain english explanation of what python does here:

1. Is x less than y?

-  If True then print "x is less than y" then stop checking conditions
-  If False check next condition

2. Is x equal to y?

-  If True then print "x is equal to y" then stop checking conditions
-  If False check next condition

2. Else is a catch all, if we got here then print "x is greather than y"
   then continue on.

you should go back to our original multiple if statement script and see
if you can explain in plain English what's going on there.

* A little bit of terminology before moving on.
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-little-bit-of-terminology-before-moving-on.
  :END:

Real quickly I want to stop for a second and explain what some of the
terminology I've been using means. When looking at an if statement
here's how you can describe each part:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    #The if statement
    #|-------|
       #The condition or expression
       #|---|
    if x < y:
        # Some code here.
        #|---------------|
          #The code block
#+END_SRC

you've also seen:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ==
    <= or >=
    < or >
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which are called comparison operators

* And now for the last bit, logical operators

This table is mostly stolen from the
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators][Mozilla
Developer Network]] and I modified it for Python because it's a
fantastic explanation.

| Operator      | Usage             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logical AND   | expr1 and expr2   | Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, and returns true if both operands can be converted to true; otherwise, returns false.                          |
| Logical OR    | expr1 or expr2    | Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, or returns true if either operand can be converted to true; if both can be converted to false, returns false.   |
| Logical NOT   | !expr             | Returns false if its single operand can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.                                                                                                                                       |

Logical operators allow you to create "Compound Conditions" which looks
something like the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if x < y and x > 0:
        print("x is a positive number that is less than y")
    elif x < y:
        print("x is less than y but is not a positive number.")
    else:
        print("x is greater than y")
#+END_SRC

What's going on here is that the statement "x is a positive number that
is less than y" will only be printed if BOTH conditions are true, that
is is x is less than y AND x is greater than 0. For instance if x = -1
and y = 2 the condition will check

is -1 < 2? Yes is -1 > 0? No

So it returns false since both statements are not true. The reverse of
this is the or statement which checks if either condition is true so for
the example above if we wrote it as:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if x < y or x > 0:
        print("x is a positive number or is less than y")
#+END_SRC

The condition would be evaluated to true since one side of the condition
is true.

is -1 < 2? Yes is -1 > 0? No

returns True

Now lets get looping!
