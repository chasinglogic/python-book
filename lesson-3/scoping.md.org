* Variable Scoping

The last topic I want to touch on in this lesson is variable scoping.
When you create a variable at the "global level" it is accesible to
anything inside the script however when you create a variable inside a
code block it is only known inside that code block.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # This variable can be referenced anywhere
    globe_trotter = 5

    def anotherfunction():
        # this will cause the script to fail. y is not defined in this scope
        print(y)

    def afunction():
        print(globe_trotter)
        y = 10

    print(globe_trotter)
    afunction()
    anotherfunction() 
#+END_SRC

This also means that anything you create inside a loop is not accessible
outside the loop. This includes the variables made in a for loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    some_names = ["mat", "joey", "scott"]

    for name in names:
       # This will work since it is inside the loop
       print(name)

    # This will fail because it is not inside the loop so name is undefined.
    print(name)
#+END_SRC

This should be pretty simple but can lead to some gotcha moments.
