1. Write down or type out the definitions for the following terms:

-  HashMap
-  Iteration
-  Array
-  Multi dimensional array

2. Write a script which prompts a user for a number and counts from 1 to
   the user inputted number the documentation for prompting for input in
   python can be found
   [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input][here]]
   Use if statements to validate input, for example don't just crash if
   the user inputs =hello=, give them a useful error message. You can
   use either a while or a for loop for this.

3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for
   multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the
   multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of
   both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

For the first fifteen numbers the output will look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    9
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
#+END_EXAMPLE

4. Create a dictionary representation for 5 dogs, put those dictionaries
   into an array. Iterate over that array printing each key and value
   for each dog with a blank new line between each dog. Your output
   should look something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    name Tanker
    breed Boston Terrier

    name Chewbacca
    breed Rotweiler

    name Roscoe
    breed Pug

    name Einstein
    breed Chihuahua

    name Chuggers
    breed Puggle
#+END_EXAMPLE

Track a little more information than just name and breed.
