* Putting the FUN in FUNction

So we named this script hello.py but it doesn't really say hello, it
just prints the name we put in your\_name, which isn't very exciting.

So now we are going to make our script say "Hello your\_name"

To do this we are going to write a function. A function in programming
is a set of code that takes some number of arguments (sometimes called
parameters) does something with those arguments and optionally returns a
value. If this sounds confusing, it's not once you see it in action.

We've already called a function in our last section, the print function.
Calling a function is as simple as writing the name of the function with
parentheses, then putting the arguments in those parentheses.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # No arguments
    print()

    # With 1 argument
    print("Arg1")

    # With 2 arguments
    print("Arg1", "Arg2")
#+END_SRC

Now I've snuck in one more new concept we'll need going forward,
comments. Any line in python preceded by a # symbol will be skipped by
the interpreter so you can use it write notes to yourself about what a
certain bit of code does. My personal opinion is to use comments
judiciously because it is always hard to put yourself back into the same
place you were when you wrote a bit of code. It's also nice for others
who might have to read your code in the future.

So now that we know how to call a function we need to write one
ourselves. Let's start with a function for saying hello to a name. Add
this code towards the top of your script (before your\_name but after
the shebang)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def say_hello(name):
        print("Hello" + name)
#+END_SRC

Let's break down this new syntax.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def say_hello(name):
#+END_SRC

/def/ is a keyword in python. A keyword is a word that has special
meaning to the interpreter and cannot be used for anything execpt it's
known use. You might also hear the term "reserved word"

The /def/ keyword specifies that we are /def/-ining a function.
following the /def/ we put the name of our function followed by parens,
in this case, say\_hello()

Inside the parentheses we put the arguments we are expecting, in this
case we are expecting a name. Now the name of the argument isn't
important here since it will be substituted with whatever the caller
gives us. We could have easiy written:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def say_hello(fart):
#+END_SRC

And it would still work the same.

Finally we add a : to the end of the line. This tells Python that
everything after this which is indented is part of this "code block" or
function.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
        print("Hello" + name)
#+END_SRC

Finally we write the "body" of our function. Everything after our def
line that is indented 4 spaces will be considered part of our function
so our function could be multiple lines of code.

Now let's change our print line from the last section to calling our new
function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    def say_hello(name):
        print("Hello" + name)

    your_name = "Mathew"
    say_hello(your_name)
#+END_SRC
