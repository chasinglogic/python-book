* Your First Application
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: your-first-application
  :END:

So if you remember we had a task list from the start of this lesson:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ! 1. create a prompt that takes user input ! 2. parse user input and
  execute the proper command ! 3. track todos ! 4. show todos ! 5. list
  todos ! 6. create todos ! 7. save and load application state ! 8. show
  a help message
#+END_QUOTE

I like to prioritize my tasks by blockers first then least effort second
and saving the hard stuff for last. For this lesson I want to tackle
these tasks:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ! 1. create a prompt that takes user input ! 2. parse user input and
  execute the proper command ! 8. show a help message
#+END_QUOTE

So with that in mind let's create our first python script named todo.py
that prints a little welcome message:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    print("""
    Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
    Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
    available then just type help or ?
    """)
#+END_SRC

*NOTE:* Remember to run through the git workflow after making a change.

Now the question is how do we prompt a user for input? this is something
we haven't done yet, but after a quick google search you can find the
official Python docs on the subject
[[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input][here]]

The tl;dr version is:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  input([prompt])

  If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output
  without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input,
  converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns
  that. When EOF is read, EOFError is raised.
#+END_QUOTE

And it gives the example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    >>> s = input('--> ')  
    --> Monty Python's Flying Circus
    >>> s  
    "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
#+END_EXAMPLE

So for in our case we want to prompt the user for input so let's do
that.

*todo.py*

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    print("""
    Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
    Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
    available then just type help or ?
    """)

    command = input("Command: ")
    print(command)
#+END_SRC

If you run this script you will see a prompt for a command and whatever
you type will then be print back at you. So now that we are prompting
for input let's parse that input to determine what command we should
run:

*todo.py*

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    def help():
        print("Available commands are new, show, list, and quit.")

    print("""
    Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
    Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
    available then just type help or ?
    """)

    command = input("Command: ")

    if command == "help" or command == "?":
        help()
    elif command == "new":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "show":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "list":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
        print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
    else:
        print("That's not a valid command!")
#+END_SRC

So now if you type help or ? you will see a worthless help message, quit
will show you the quit message and all other commands will let you know
that they aren't implemented yet, otherwise we'll tell you it was an
invalid command.

Unfortunately our script only asks for a command once, but we want this
application to run until the user is done so to do that we use a loop!

*todo.py*

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    def help():
        print("Available commands are new, show, list, and quit.")

    print("""
    Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
    Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
    available then just type help or ?
    """)

    while True:
        command = input("Command: ")
        
        if command == "help" or command == "?":
            help()
        elif command == "new":
            print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
        elif command == "show":
            print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
        elif command == "list":
            print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
        elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
            print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
            break
        else:
            print("That's not a valid command!")
#+END_SRC

The import thing to note is the addition of the break keyword to the
quit command that way our infinite loop can end. Run the script now and
you'll notice that you are continually prompted for input until you type
quit!

With that done we've successfully checked three items off of our task
list!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ! 1. create a prompt that takes user input ! 2. parse user input and
  execute the proper command ! 8. show a help message
#+END_QUOTE

Next lesson we'll be completing the tasks:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ! 6. create todos ! 5. list todos
#+END_QUOTE
