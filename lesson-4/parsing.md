# Create and List todos
So continuing from last time we will be tackling:

>! 6. create todos
>! 5. list todos

To list todos we need to be able to create them so let's start there.
The basic version of this command would be `new <todo title>` to do this we'll
need to do newitional text parsing, since `new write my book` is not equal to
`new` as we were previously checking, we need a new way to tell that I want to
run the new command. Consulting the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=starts#str.startswith)
shows us that strings have a startswith method that checks if a string has a prefix.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def help():
    print("Available commands are new, show, list, and quit.")

print("""
Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
available then just type help or ?
""")

while True:
    command = input("Command: ")
    
    if command == "help" or command == "?":
        help()
    elif command.startswith("new"):
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "show":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "list":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
        print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
        break
    else:
        print("That's not a valid command!")
```

Now if you run the script you can successfully run `new write my book` and get
the proper message. Now let's write our new command, when writing CLI's of
any kind I prefer to write each command as it's own function, the first thing we
need to do in our function is extract the title of the todo from our command.
Since the syntax is for our command is always command space title then we can
use this to extract that title.

Once again we consult the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=starts#str.split) 
(Starting to see a theme?) and see that strings have a `split()` method that we
can use to seperate our string into an array that we can use.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def help():
    print("Available commands are new, show, list, and quit.")

def new(command):
    parsed_args = command.split(' ')
    print(parsed_args)

print("""
Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
available then just type help or ?
""")

while True:
    command = input("Command: ")
    
    if command == "help" or command == "?":
        help()
    elif command.startswith("new"):
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "show":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "list":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
        print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
        break
    else:
        print("That's not a valid command!")
```

If you run the new `new` command you will see it prints an array of the command
where it was seperated on the space character. Now we can use a python feature
called slicing to skip the first part of the array (which in this case is 
the word new that we don't need.)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def help():
    print("Available commands are new, show, list, and quit.")

def new(command):
    parsed_args = command.split(' ')[1:]
    print(parsed_args)

print("""
Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
available then just type help or ?
""")

while True:
    command = input("Command: ")
    
    if command == "help" or command == "?":
        help()
    elif command.startswith("new"):
        new(command)
    elif command == "show":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "list":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
        print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
        break
    else:
        print("That's not a valid command!")
```

The output of running our new command should look like this:

```
super_todo $ python3 todo.py

Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
available then just type help or ?

Command: new write a book
['write', 'a', 'book']
Command: quit
Thanks for using Super Todo!
super_todo $
```

Now we need to join our new array back into a string, in python this is slightly
strange since it's a method on strings but not on the array itsself, here
is the relevant [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=starts#str.join)

Using this info our script looks like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def help():
    print("Available commands are new, show, list, and quit.")

def new(command):
    parsed_args = command.split(' ')[1:]
    title = ' '.join(parsed_args)
    print("Creating a new todo:", title)

print("""
Welcome to Super Todo! This is a CLI to organize your life like it's 1999!
Just type a command to get started, if you need to know what commands are
available then just type help or ?
""")

while True:
    command = input("Command: ")
    
    if command == "help" or command == "?":
        help()
    elif command.startswith("new"):
        new(command)
    elif command == "show":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "list":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
        print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
        break
    else:
        print("That's not a valid command!")
```

Going forward, I'm only going to show you the relevant function we are working
on since our script is getting rather large.

Ok so now we need to listen for potentially multi-line content from our users,
here is the relevant [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17016240/multiline-user-input-python)
so let's write a function to do that: 

```python
def get_longform_user_input():
    lines = []
    line = input()

    while line != '':
        lines.append(line)
        line = input()

    return '\n'.join(lines)
```

One new concept in this snippet is the `'\n'` which is an escape character,
specifically `\n` is the "newline character" meaning a carriage return or the
equivalent of pressing enter.

The other new concept in this snippet is append, appending means to "add to the
end to". So in this instance lines is a list and we are adding each new line of
user input to this list, after we are finished we join the list into a string and
return it.

Now we can update our new function:

```python
def new(command):
    parsed_args = command.split(' ')[1:]
    title = ' '.join(parsed_args)
    print("Creating a new todo:", title)
    print("Write a short description for this todo. Enter an empty line when finished.")
    body = get_longform_user_input()
    return { 'title': title, 'body': body, }
```

Now we use our new function to get the long input into body, and then new returns
a dictionary of the title and body. Unfortunately our app isn't keeping track
of the created todo's so it just dumps them into nothingness, let's change that:

```python
todos = []

while True:
    command = input("Command: ")
    
    if command == "help" or command == "?":
        help()
    elif command.startswith("new"):
        todos.append(new(command))
    elif command == "show":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "list":
        print("Sorry that's not implemented yet!")
    elif command == "quit" or command == "exit":
        print("Thanks for using Super Todo!")
        break
    else:
        print("That's not a valid command!")
```

Now we have a global array of todos and when the user creates a new one we
add it to the array, this won't give us persistence of todos between runs of 
the application but it will give us persistence while the application is running
and I'd say that minimally viable for now.

Next lets write the command that will list our current todos:

```python
def list():
    for todo in todos:
        print(todo)
```

Since the variable todos is a global variable we can just access it directly
here in our function, this should be a pretty straight forward function to you
now. 

Go ahead and test this out, make sure you add the function call to your while 
loop or else the list function won't work!

Have you tested it?, alright notice how the output is pretty ugly? that's because
we are just printing the raw dictionary to the user which is not what we want.

So let's do a little more formatted output:

```python
def list():
    print()
    print("Your current todo list:")
    print()
    for index, todo in enumerate(todos):
        print("\t", index + 1, todo['title'])
    print()
```

A couple new things in this snippet, first the [enumerate function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate)
is another builtin function which will give you the index with the element in your
for loop.

Then we are passing multiple arguments to print so it will automatically concatenate
(combine) them for us and do type conversions where appropriate. The reason
we do index + 1 is because as Humans we start our lists at 1 but remember that
arrays are **0 indexed** so we need to add one to make it match our brains.
Finally we only want to print the title here so we get using the accessor.

Try out our new list function out and see what you think, we're actually getting
somewhere now!

Next chapter we will tackle showing todos and update our help message to be more
helpful.
