# Syntatic Sugar


### A brief aside about syntax

The thing that makes Python an awesome programming language is that it
has very little actual "syntax". If you're unaware of what syntax is no
worries. Syntax is a character or symbol which has only meaning to the
computer. Such as parentheses in Math. You can use the syntax of parens
in math to seperate calculations from one another for example:

2 + 3 / 5 `/` (2 + 3) / 5

The parentheses have special meaning in the context. The syntax of a
programming language is much the same.


### Let's write our first code!

Python, like all scripting languages, is interpreted. This means
naturally that there is an interpreter! The python command will start
this interpreter and we can type Python code directly into it (which is
pretty cool). So run the python command and you should see:

	Python 3.5.1 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27)
	[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.39)] on darwin
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>>

Or something very similar. The >>> is the prompt where you can type code
and see it be executed! Try it now type 5 then press enter.

	>>> 5
	5
	>>>

Sweet right? If you type 5 + 10, what do you think will happen? Once you
have a guess try it out!
