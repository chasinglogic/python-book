* A final note on variables
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-final-note-on-variables

I know it seems like we're spending a ton of time on variables but
that's because you will use them in EVERY SINGLE python program you
write.

The last couple tricks I want to show you are pretty vital so make sure
you understand all of it before moving on.

You can increment or decrement an integer / float variable like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    >>> num1 = 5
    >>> num1 += 1
    >>> num1
    6
#+END_SRC

If you reverse the signage you will decrement the variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    >>> num1 -= 1
    >>> num1
    5
#+END_SRC

You can reassign a variable to another value, and since Python is duck
typed you can reassign it to a value of a different type.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    >>> num1 = 5
    >>> num1 = "A number"
#+END_SRC

And that's completely valid (though bad practice unless you have a VERY
good reason.)

You can set a variable to the value of another variable then they act
indenpendently. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    >>> num1 = 5
    >>> num2 = num1
    >>> num1 += 5
    >>> num1
    10
    >>> num2
    5
#+END_SRC

You can set the value of a variable to the result of an operation, such
as a function call (foreshadowing) or math. This can include another
variable as well, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    >>> num1 = 5
    >>> num2 = 5
    >>> num3 = 10 + 3
    >>> num4 = num2 + 8
    >>> num3
    13
    >>> num4
    13
    >>> num2
    5
#+END_SRC
