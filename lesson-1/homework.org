1. Play with variables of different types, see what adding / subtracting
   / multiplying / dividing does when you go across types or when acting
   on the same type.
2. Assign some variables to the results of another variable. Make sure
   you understand how this works.
3. Look up Camel Case, Snake Case, and Pascal Case. Make sure you
   understand why we name variables the way we do, i.e. my\_variable = 3
   not my variable = 3
